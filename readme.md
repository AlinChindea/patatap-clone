# Patatap clone

## Intro
This is a clone of the famous [Patatap app](http://patatap.com). I have used [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/about/) and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) and vanillaJS for this exercise.

You can clone or fork the ***[repository](https://github.com/EagleEye182/patatap-clone)***. 

While the app will work, you might get a Cross Origin error in the console. To get rid of the Cross Origin errors in the console, you'll need to run a local HTTP server from your project's directory and load the circles.html file from there. The steps are as follows if you're using a Mac:

*Note: if using Windows, this might be a tad more complex (see some instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tq4F-E-dGB22O4qs7YsvpcdxXmwj9SJ0-GZVccyeaSU/edit).

1) navigate to your project folder in the terminal

2) run: 

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

3) open up your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

4) select the circles.html file
